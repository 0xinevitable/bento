## üöÄ Preparing Local Dev Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inevitable-changes/bento
cd bento
yarn
```

- First, clone this repo.
- Since we're using [Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) through Yarn Berry's Plug'n'Play, the repository's initial clone size might be significantly larger than you think.

```env
ENVIRONMENT=debug
MAIN_API_BASE_URL=https://www.bento.finance
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENSEA_API_KEYS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CMC_PRO_API_KEYS=

COVALENT_API_KEYS=
SLACK_NEW_PROFILE_WEBHOOK=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
REDIS_URL=
```

- Copy `.env.example` inside `@bento/api`(`apps/api/.env.*`) and `@bento/web`(`apps/web/.env.*`) and fill in the contents.

```bash
yarn build
```

- We're using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) with Yarn Workspaces.

```bash
yarn workspace @bento/web dev
```

- Finally, we start the development server. By default, the port is set to `3000`.

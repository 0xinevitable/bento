# üç± Bento, The open-source web3 dashboard

## The Status Quo

- All **dashboard services** out there are either:
  - **Associated with specific Layer-1 chains built by the same team or shared VCs**
    - Timid movement outside of their current eco
  - **Maintained as close source software; Development is centralized to the team**
    - If you want your protocol listed, you have to depend on the team to add support

## Mission

- Make **every user track every asset they own,** regardless of chains and types
- Make **any builder add support** for their protocol/app freely
- Provide **social profiles** based on web3

## üöÄ Preparing Local Dev Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inevitable-changes/dashboard
cd dashboard
yarn install
```

First, clone this repo.
Since we're using [Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) through Yarn Berry's Plug'n'Play, the repository's initial clone size can be larger than you think.

```bash
yarn workspace @bento/core build
```

The Entire project is managed as a monorepo using Yarn Workspaces.
So the `@bento/core` module must be built first. If there are any modifications to `@bento/core,` you don't have to turn off the `@bento/web` development server‚Äîjust build it right away, and it will reload itself(still, it might require a restart when there are dependency changes).

```bash
yarn workspace @bento/web dev
```

Finally, we start the development server. By default, the port is set to `3000`.

  "DASHBOARD_PARA_2": "Investing in DeFi? View not only balances but your stakes for various protocols as well.",

  "STATUS_QUO_DESC": "Exactly. Users are entirely different from wallets, <br />a more extensive concept by itself. <br />But current web3 products treat them the same. <br />In the cross-chain universe, user activities and assets no longer remain in one address or chain."
